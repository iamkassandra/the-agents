## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ or Bun
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-agent-team.git
   cd ai-agent-team
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   Configure the following variables:
   ```env
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key
   REFRESH_SECRET=your-refresh-secret-key
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=secure-admin-2024
   WS_PORT=8080
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

5. **Visit the application**
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Default Login
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `secure-admin-2024`

## 📖 Usage

### Authentication
The platform includes a comprehensive authentication system with secure login/logout functionality. Users are automatically redirected to the login page if not authenticated.

### Agent Dashboard
Access the main dashboard to monitor all AI agents, view system statistics, and manage active tasks and projects.

### Autonomous Demo
Try the autonomous business development demo at `/demo` to experience the full AI agent workflow:

1. Enter a business idea
2. Watch AI agents collaborate in real-time
3. Monitor progress through 7 development phases
4. View the generated application

### WebSocket Integration
Real-time communication is available through WebSocket connections at `ws://localhost:8080/ws/agents` with authentication and subscription-based event handling.
